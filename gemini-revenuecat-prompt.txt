I'm getting a RevenueCat subscription error in my iOS app with this exact message: "The receipt is not valid. The purchased product was missing in the receipt. This is typically due to a bug in StoreKit."

Here's my setup:
- Using @revenuecat/purchases-capacitor version ^11.1.1 in a Capacitor iOS app
- Have not changed any product configurations recently
- Error occurs when attempting to purchase subscription packages
- RevenueCat SDK is initialized with proper API key from Supabase edge function
- Testing on physical iOS device (not simulator)

The error appears to be a client-side receipt validation failure, not a server-side issue. My RevenueCat webhook was recently fixed for database column naming issues, but this seems unrelated to that.

What are the most common causes of this specific StoreKit receipt validation error in RevenueCat integrations? Please provide:

1. Step-by-step troubleshooting approach
2. Common configuration mismatches that cause this error
3. How to verify RevenueCat product setup vs App Store Connect
4. Sandbox testing considerations that might cause this
5. Any known iOS version or Capacitor-specific issues
6. How to debug RevenueCat SDK receipt validation process

Focus on practical solutions I can implement immediately to resolve this receipt validation failure.
